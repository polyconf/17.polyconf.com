    title: The spectrum of polymorphism
    abstract: Even if polymorphism is one of the first concepts we learn as developers, it is actually a very profound notion in software construction. In this presentation taking C++ as an example, you’ll see that polymorphism can itself take a wide variety of shapes and in particular different moments of resolution. And more importantly, how to pick the one that is most adapted to your design.

        title: Ada 99 - Rewriting the very first computer program
        abstract: When working in C++ I tend to solve every problem with a C++-shaped hammer. When working in Javascript, every problem looks like a Javascript-shaped hammer. And so on. Getting back to thinking about the problem first, and the implementation second, is a difficult mind shift. So I set about re-writing the same code in each of the 16 different languages in which I’ve professionally developed. This talk will take you on that journey of discovery highlighting many ideas to expand your own thought processes.

        title: There Is No Spoon? Understanding ‘Spoon Theory’ and Preventing Burnout
        abstract: Spoon theory is a metaphor about the finite energy we each have to do things in a day. While a healthy, advantaged person may not have to worry about running out of ‘spoons,’ people with chronic illnesses or disabilities and members of marginalized groups must consider how to ration their energy to get through the day. Understanding this can help companies lessen the everyday burdens on their underrepresented employees, leaving them more spoons to do their best work, avoid burnout and lead fulfilling lives.

While it’s relatively easy to build a new web app in React, migrating a service that’s constantly changing and used by millions of people is a much more complicated challenge. It’s like changing the engines of an airplane while mid-flight. The talk is about techniques we tried and challenges we faced while migrating to React at Pinterest.

        abstract: 'Homoiconicity is a word the Clojure community likes to use heavily. It’s a cool property of the Clojure language: it means that code can be treated as data. We as computer people are used to handling data: we can visualise it, analyse it and even generate it. What does it imply if we can do the same things with our Clojure code? I will investigate this question through a series examples and hopefully help you understand this abstract concept better.'

We'll compare Pony to more mature technologies, starting with when you shouldn't use it, when you should, and what your alternatives might be. You'll learn about Pony's design philosophy, how the actors simplify writing safe code and more. You'll leave understanding what Pony is and if it's something you might use.

        title: Polyglot From the Very Old to the Very New
        abstract: Writing programs in a high-level language such as Ruby, with extensions written in C, is probably the earliest form of polyglot. In GraalVM we're rethinking this from first principles and actually interpreting C extensions using the latest in virtual machine technology.

        title: ZetaVM, A Platform to Enable Programming Language Innovation 
        abstract: This talk will introduce ZetaVM, a new platform designed to enable anyone to create their own programming language. ZetaVM is designed primarily for enthusiasts rather than for industry, and takes a fresh look at the foundations on which modern VMs are built. Planned features include a simple text-based bytecode format, the ability to introspect running code and generate new bytecode at run-time, a functional/compositional approach to sound and graphics, as well as GPU-based acceleration using an SPMD programming model.

        title: Elixir FFI with Rust
        abstract: Elixir is a functional language which runs on the Erlang VM. The unique design of the VM makes the language a great choice for writing applications which does networking and other forms of IO. Although Elixir excels in many areas, sometimes you need to do something that requires a lower-level language. In this talk we're going to discuss how Rust and the Rustler project can make interacting with native code both safer and easier for the programmer.

        title: Stop Guessing and Start Measuring - Benchmarking in Practice
        abstract: “What’s the fastest way of doing this?” - you might ask yourself during development. Sure, you can guess, your intuition might be correct - but how do you know? Benchmarking is here to give you the answers, but there are many pitfalls in setting up a good benchmark and analyzing the results. This talk will guide you through, introduce best practices, and surprise you with some unexpected benchmarking results. You didn’t think that the order of arguments could influence its performance...or did you?

        title: 'Mobile Web to Native Development: JavaScript, React, Swift, and React Native'
        abstract: Today, mobile web traffic is greater than desktop traffic. Many of us didn't think this would be possible, 10 years ago. Most of our tools were built around desktop web has been long obsolete, but they still haunt us in our transition to mobile web development. With the evolution of JavaScript (es6 and beyond), along with React, we are getting closer to native development. With the benefit of mobile web (ubiquitous and cross platform), along with native-like experience, what will the future be like?

        title: The spectrum of polymorphism
        abstract: Even if polymorphism is one of the first concepts we learn as developers, it is actually a very profound notion in software construction. In this presentation taking C++ as an example, you’ll see that polymorphism can itself take a wide variety of shapes and in particular different moments of resolution. And more importantly, how to pick the one that is most adapted to your design.

        title: "Tearing Down Walls: Web APIs for Desktop Applications"
        abstract: Very few desktop apps expose APIs. In part, the use cases are just too obscure to bother with. But in part, building APIs requires us to bridge the web and the desktop, and that's not very easy. But it can be done. And you can do it too. One of my first jobs at Screenhero was to build an API that allowed Slack to control our desktop application. Journey with me through Screenhero’s API and see how we blended Ruby, Erlang, C, JavaScript, and sheer naïveté, all so you could type `/hero` into Slack and watch magic happen.

        title: Programming across paradigms 
        abstract: The programming paradigm we work in shapes every aspect of how we craft our code, providing a model of what a program is, and what it can and should be. In this talk, we’ll explore the connections between the programs we write, the languages we work in, and the paradigms we use, and try to get some historical and philosophical perspective on the familiar paradigms of imperative, declarative, object-oriented, and functional programming, focusing on the points where they intersect and collide. We’ll discover the valuable lessons different paradigms can teach us, and find motivation to stop arguing with our fellow coders about which is superior, and instead encourage each other - as individuals and a community - to pursue poly-paradigm programming.

        title: What I Talk About When I Talk About Running on the Web 
        abstract: Web engines have evolved into sophisticated virtual machines. Millions of developers build for the web platform, and the resulting code runs on everything. Servo aims to be far more than a web browser engine by allowing developers to embed it in their own applications and by building a runtime based on web technology. In this talk, Jack will cover motivations, use cases, and potential new programming models.

      In this training session, we will cover modern [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) programming best practices, with an emphasis on creating real world, production-ready applications. This will include program structure, recommended libraries, and tooling configuration. The techniques will be relevant to most programming domains, including network programming, concurrent applications, and data science. Familiarity with Haskell syntax and basic programming ability is assumed, and ample Q&A sections will be available.

      The course will roughly follow [the FP Complete Haskell Syllabus](https://www.fpcomplete.com/haskell-syllabus). Based on user feedback in advance of the session, the planned topics will be updated to accommodate audience interest.
