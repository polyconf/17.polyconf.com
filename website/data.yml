    title: The spectrum of polymorphism
    abstract: Even if polymorphism is one of the first concepts we learn as developers, it is actually a very profound notion in software construction. In this presentation taking C++ as an example, you’ll see that polymorphism can itself take a wide variety of shapes and in particular different moments of resolution. And more importantly, how to pick the one that is most adapted to your design.

        title: Ada 99 - Rewriting the very first computer program
        abstract: When working in C++ I tend to solve every problem with a C++-shaped hammer. When working in Javascript, every problem looks like a Javascript-shaped hammer. And so on. Getting back to thinking about the problem first, and the implementation second, is a difficult mind shift. So I set about re-writing the same code in each of the 16 different languages in which I’ve professionally developed. This talk will take you on that journey of discovery highlighting many ideas to expand your own thought processes.

        abstract: During the last months I've written from scratch Barrel is a modern document-oriented database with master-master replication targeting micro-services with a RESTful API written in Erlang. This talk will describe the different challenges we faced in writing a database, from binding C code in Erlang, to write a complete SQL Engine. This talk will also describe the different patterns used for Reads and Writes concurrency but also continuous automated indexation of the documents.

        title: Going serverless
        abstract: Serverless might change the industry in a big way. Miss it out and you soon might be out of business, as your competition will save huge infrastructure money, developers time and will scale better than you. Presentation is an introduction, but with hard technical insights on how the serverless is really different what classic and microservices design.

        title: There Is No Spoon? Understanding ‘Spoon Theory’ and Preventing Burnout
        abstract: Spoon theory is a metaphor about the finite energy we each have to do things in a day. While a healthy, advantaged person may not have to worry about running out of ‘spoons,’ people with chronic illnesses or disabilities and members of marginalized groups must consider how to ration their energy to get through the day. Understanding this can help companies lessen the everyday burdens on their underrepresented employees, leaving them more spoons to do their best work, avoid burnout and lead fulfilling lives.

While it’s relatively easy to build a new web app in React, migrating a service that’s constantly changing and used by millions of people is a much more complicated challenge. It’s like changing the engines of an airplane while mid-flight. The talk is about techniques we tried and challenges we faced while migrating to React at Pinterest.

Four years later, this talk dives into our reasons for doing so, our experiences as a small team in running production code through a compiler that we were writing at the same time, and what it took to ensure the stability of our domain-specific language and the proficiency of its users.

        abstract: 'Homoiconicity is a word the Clojure community likes to use heavily. It’s a cool property of the Clojure language: it means that code can be treated as data. We as computer people are used to handling data: we can visualise it, analyse it and even generate it. What does it imply if we can do the same things with our Clojure code? I will investigate this question through a series examples and hopefully help you understand this abstract concept better.'

        abstract: Pony is a new language designed to make fast, concurrent programing simple. Its actor-based concurrency and advanced type system ensure programs are data race and deadlock free. We'll compare Pony to more mature technologies, starting with when you shouldn't use it, when you should, and what your alternatives might be. You'll learn about Pony's design philosophy, how the actors simplify writing safe code and more. You'll leave understanding what Pony is and if it's something you might use.

        abstract: “What’s the fastest way of doing this?” - you might ask yourself during development. Sure, you can guess, your intuition might be correct - but how do you know? Benchmarking is here to give you the answers, but there are many pitfalls in setting up a good benchmark and analyzing the results. This talk will guide you through, introduce best practices, and surprise you with some unexpected benchmarking results. You didn’t think that the order of arguments could influence its performance...or did you?

        title: 'Mobile Web to Native Development: JavaScript, React, Swift, and React Native'
        abstract: Today, mobile web traffic is greater than desktop traffic. Many of us didn't think this would be possible, 10 years ago. Most of our tools were built around desktop web has been long obsolete, but they still haunt us in our transition to mobile web development. With the evolution of JavaScript (es6 and beyond), along with React, we are getting closer to native development. With the benefit of mobile web (ubiquitous and cross platform), along with native-like experience, what will the future be like?

        title: One VM to Rule Them All
        abstract: Graal is a new just-in-time compiler for the Java Virtual Machine with support for the Truffle polyglot framework. Integrated language runtimes include JavaScript, Ruby, and R. Additionally, it supports LLVM-based languages such as C, C++, Go, and Rust. Graal enables seamless language interoperability while also providing world-class performance for each individual language. A demo will show how JavaScript, Java, Ruby, R, and C can work together in a single web application running in one VM!

        title: The spectrum of polymorphism
        abstract: Even if polymorphism is one of the first concepts we learn as developers, it is actually a very profound notion in software construction. In this presentation taking C++ as an example, you’ll see that polymorphism can itself take a wide variety of shapes and in particular different moments of resolution. And more importantly, how to pick the one that is most adapted to your design.

  - title: An Intro to React Workshop
    name: Wes Bos
    link: http://wesbos.com/
    description: |
      This is a 1 day, 6-8 hour workshop aimed at understanding the fundamentals of React. Throughout the day we will work to incrementally build an application touching all every major point of React:

      * Creating Components and writing HTML with JSX
      * Routing with React Router
      * Understanding State and holding data
      * Passing data between components with with Props
      * Fetching data from an Ajax endpoint
      * Persisting data with LocalStorage
      * Working with Events in React
      * Working with Forms, retrieving data from DOM inputs
      * Stateless Functional Components
      * React Deployment


      Together we will build [React.Beer](http://React.beer), an interactive Beer explorer single page application. Along the way we will learn each fundamental concept, take time to implement it in our application and understand both the _Whys_ and _hows_ of the way React works.

      Students are expected to have Beginner to intermediate JavaScript skills — you should know how functions, variables, arguments and all the basics of JavaScript work.
    requirments:
      - Please note that a computer will not be provided, so please bring your own laptop to the workshop
      - the latest version of Node.js Installed - you can download the installer over at Nodejs.org. If you aren't sure if you have node installed, open a terminal window and type `node -v`, compare that against the latest version at http://nodejs.org
      - A terminal / command line application. For Windows I recommend [cmder](http://cmder.net/), though the built in one will work just fine. For OSX built in Terminal, [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) or [Hyper.app](https://hyperterm.now.sh/) will work as well. 
      - 'A text editor. You may use any editor but here are some good ones: Sublime Text with [Babel-Sublime](https://github.com/babel/babel-sublime) syntax highlighter installed or [Atom](https://atom.io/)'
