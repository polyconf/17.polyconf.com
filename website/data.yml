    title: The spectrum of polymorphism
    abstract: Even if polymorphism is one of the first concepts we learn as developers, it is actually a very profound notion in software construction. In this presentation taking C++ as an example, you’ll see that polymorphism can itself take a wide variety of shapes and in particular different moments of resolution. And more importantly, how to pick the one that is most adapted to your design.

    company: Murex
    bio: I've been a C++ software developer for 6 years, working for Murex which is a major software editor in the finance industry. My focus is on studying how to write expressive code, and how to make existing code more expressive. I sometimes take inspiration from Functional Programming with Haskell as a second language. And I blog regularly about expressive code in C++ on Fluent C++ (http://fluentcpp.com)
